	Hi, I am Rishabh. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> in New York City. I graduated from New York Universtiy in May 2018 where I took some great <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/">Math and Computer Science </a> classes, did <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research/">research</a>, worked on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/">projects</a>, tutored/TA'ed and tried a bunch of things.
</p>

I use this space to:

* keep track of papers I read (these days reinforcement learning related)
* programming
* mathematical finance (exploring this) 
* ... and just things I am trying to learn.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions at either of the following:
* ranawat dot rishabh at gmail dot com

Thanks for reading!
