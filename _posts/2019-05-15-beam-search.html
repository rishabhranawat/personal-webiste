<p>Beam Search Algorithm: 

Wiki details: Beam search uses breadth-first-search to build its search tree. At each level of the tree, it generates all successors of the states at the current level, sorting them in increasing order of heurisitc cost. However, it only explores a predetermined number, \( \Beta \), of best states at each level --> beam width. Only those states are expanded next. The greater the beam width, the fewer states are pruned.

A beam search is most often used to maintain tractability in large systems with insufficient amount of memory to store the entire search tree.
