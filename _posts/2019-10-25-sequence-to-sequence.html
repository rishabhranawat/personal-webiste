deep neural networks are extremely powerful machine learning models that achieve excellent perfomance on difficult problems.

If there exists a parameter setting of a large DNN that achieves good results, supervised backpropagation will find these parameters and solve the problem.

Many important problems are best expressed with sequences whose lengths are not known a-priori. For example, speec recognition and machine translation are sequential problems. Likewise, question-answering can also be seen as mapping a sequence of words representing the question to a sequence of words representing the answer. It is therefore clear that a domain-independent method that learns to map sequences to sequences would be useful.

In this paper, the authors show that a straighforward application of LSTM architecture can solve general sequence to sequence problems.

The idea is to use one LSTM to read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, to obtain a large fixed dimensional vector representation, and then to use another LSTM to extract the output sequence from that vector. The second LSTM is essentially a recurrent neural network language model except that it is conditioned on the input sequence.

A useful property of the LSTM is that it learns to map an input sequence of variable length into a fixed dimensional vector representation.
