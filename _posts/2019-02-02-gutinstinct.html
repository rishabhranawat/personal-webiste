<blockquote>Gut Instinct: Creating Scientific Theories with Online Learning</blockquote>

Our intuition is that scientific crowdsourcing will most usefully contribute to domains where science is nascent and/or highly contextual. The human microbiome project is both.

This paper explores the potential of coupling online citizen science with learning materials to create scientific questions.

Example:

Foldit players discovered protein structures that helped scientists understand how the AIDS virus reproduces.

<b>The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that a crowd of online non-expert learners can collaboratively perform useful scientifc work.</b>

Gut Instinct, which brings together learnes to perform useful collaborative brainstorming on a citizen science project while developing expertise.

Collectively aggregating many people's responses can produce faster, better, and more reliable results - at much larger scale - than lone individuals can, at least errors andd biases are independent events.

Our novel contribution is an explicit integration of learning.


Hypotheses:
Learning improves quality of work on relevant problems.
 Working on relevant real-world problems improves learning.
 Working while learning improves learnersâ€™ en- gagement with the learning material.
