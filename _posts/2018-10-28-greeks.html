    <h2>Delta One Derivatives</h2>

    <blockquoute>What is a Delta?</blockquote>
    <p> 
    	\( \Delta \) measures the sensitivity of a derivative's value to changes in the price of the underlying asset. 

    	The \( \Delta \) of an instrument is the rate of change of the derivative's value w.r.t. to the underlying asset's price a.k.a., the first derivative.
    </p>


    <blockquote>Leads us to Delta One</blockquote>
    Delta One products are financial derivatives that have no option(ality) and as such have a \( \Delta \) of \( ~ 1\). This means that for a given instantaneous move in the price of the underlying asset there is expected to be an identical move in the price of the derivative.



    <blockquote>Linear Symmetric Payoff</blockquote>
    A feature of certain types of derivatives, such as forwards, futures and swaps that offer equal opportunity for gains and 
    losses.


    <blockquote>Examples of Delta One products</blockquote>
    A Delta One product is a derivative with a linear, symmetric payoff profile. That is, a derivative that is not an option or a product with embedded options. 

    <ul>
    	<li>Exchange Traded Funds</li>
    	<li>Equity Swaps</li>
    	<li>Forwards</li>
    	<li>Exchange Traded Notes</li>
    </ul>

    Let's dive slightly deep into ETFs:

    ETFs is a pretty common Delta One product. A hedge fund manager that wants to gain exposure to a certain basket of stocks doesn't have to buy each of those stocks outright themselves, which may be troublesome in balancing and transaction costs. The fund manager can buy the ETF of that basket of stocks with capital required up front and gain the same exposure.
