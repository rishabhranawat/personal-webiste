This is a reading of Program2Tutor by Tongu Mu et. al.

The primary contribution of this work:
1. Automatic Curriculum Generation from execution traces and;
2. Automatic problem selection using RL techniques

Defn: Let \( n \) be any positive integer. We say that a trace \( T_1 \) is at least as complex as trace \( T_2 \) if every n-gram of trace \( T_2 \) is also present in trace \( T_1 \).
