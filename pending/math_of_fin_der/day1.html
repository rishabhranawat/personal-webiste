<p>Background reading for modern asset pricing theory</p>

Pricing models for financial derivatives require, by their very nature,
utilization of continous-time stochastic processes. 

Three major steps in the theoretical revolution led to the use of advanced
mathematical methods:


<li>
<ul>1. The arbitrage theorem gives the formal conditions under which
"arbitrage profits" can or cannot exist. It is known that
if asset prices satisfy a simple condition, then arbitrage cannot
exit. This was a major development that eventually permitted
the calculation of the arbitrage-free price of any "new" derivative
product.</ul>

<ul>Black Scholes model: used the method of arbitrage free pricing. But the
paper was also infleuntial because of the technical steps introduced in obtaining
a closed form formula of option prices.</ul>

<ul>Using equivalent martingale measures was developed later. This method
dramatically simplified and generalized the original approach of Black and Scholes.
With these tools, a general method could be used to price any derivative product.</ul>

</li>

The value of derivatives often depends only on the value of the underlying asset, some interest
rates, and a few parameters to be calculated. It is significantly easier to model such an instrument
mathematically than, say, to model stocks.

</ul>

Derivative securities are financial contracts that "derive" their value
from the cash market instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.

A financial contract is a derivative security, or a contingent claim if its
value at expiration date T is determined exactly by the market price of the
underlying cash instrument at time T.
