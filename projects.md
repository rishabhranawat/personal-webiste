<strong><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/documents/speeding-svt.pdf">Speeding Up Singular Value Thresholding</a></strong><br>
<p class="message">
	In this paper, we discuss a Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) algorithm for matrix completion proposed by Cai et. al. The SVT is a simple first-order and an easy to implement algorithm that is efficient at addressing problems that have low rank solutions. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm and its different SVD variants on 3 different datasets - (E1) randomly generated matrices (E2) matrix of Geodesic distances between cities (E3) student learning datasets.

with Arvi Gjoka and Yun Bin Zhang <br>
<p class="message">
	In this project, we tried to investigate how well can a discriminator act as an independent classifier. We ran experiments to evaluate its performance against VGG.
